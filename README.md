# Rust Chip-8 Emulator

Generic Chip-8 Emulator used as an exercise in practicing both emulator and rust programming.

Probably over documented, but when practicing, I like to make sure I can explain in my own words, and go back to the code later and immidiately learn.

To run, in the base directory:

```
    cargo run <rom_filename>
```
